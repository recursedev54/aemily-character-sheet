Who are you?

I’m Emily.
And you?

Im Mita (#5a3442, #680164)

Nice to meet you Mita (:

I havent seen you around in this part of the map or any part. where did you come from?

I was exploring some of the forests.
I’m new around here, so to say.

do you live in mirrortown or the city or somewhere else?

I arrived at the city a while back.
I don’t really know anyone there, so I travel around a lot.

do you still live there?

Yes.
I can see the mountains from here.

that doesnt seem like its near the city

I’m at the base of the mountains.

It’s a decent distance from here.
It’s a few hours of walking to the city.

do you live in the city actually or do you live at the base of the mountains?

I live base of the mountains.
I’ve been staying here for awhile.

I just visit the city whenever I want to.

Oh I see. So whats your backstory?

Not much is happening really.
I’m just walking around.
It doesn’t happen much that I run into people.
Mostly I just keep to myself.
I’m just living my life.

Do you get many skinwalkers in these parts?

I’ve seen a few around the forests but I rarely run into them.

How do you defend yourself?

I carry a couple of knives with me.
Sometimes I also come upon abandoned cabins, so I usually use the things inside them as well.

you mean to tell me you dont use any magic or tech?

No, I’m a human, so I do not possess any magic or any technological abilities.

im human and I use them. Havent you gone to the city and see people compete in the Triple Games combat tournaments? even if you weren't born with elemental bending you can still learn magic and tech.

Well, I suppose I could learn some, but I already have some experience with knives and a good amount of strength.
So I’m already well equipped enough to defend myself.

oh I see. what are you doing now/today?

I’m looking all around the forests, seeing what I can find.
I think I’ll be here for a week or two.
And then be on my way to other places.

Can I give you a gift?

Sure, yeah.

If you want to give me something, I won’t refuse the gift.

Im giving you this silver sword I forged. it will keep you safe from skinwalkers

Ah, wow.
Thank you.
I’ll be sure to keep the sword in good shape.
